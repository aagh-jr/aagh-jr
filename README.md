## abel angel gonzalez hernandez — designer / researcher / builder

interested in:
- interaction as storytelling.  
- technology as relationship.  
- design as care.

currently based in san jose — studying cognitive science with a specialization in human-computer interacton.
I like to design and create things that feel warm, helpful, and get our minds thinking and going.
